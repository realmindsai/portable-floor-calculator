"""cooldown — is the uv publish-age gate actually declared, and did the lock keep it?

The gate used to live only in a shell wrapper on one Mac, so any `uv run` on a
server re-resolved without it and dropped the recorded window from uv.lock.
Committed `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` is the fix; this check is what stops the
next repo from being created without it.
