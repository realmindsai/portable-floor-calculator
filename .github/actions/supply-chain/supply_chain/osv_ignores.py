# ABOUTME: Flags osv-scanner ignore entries that have lapsed or were never time-bounded
# ABOUTME: An acceptance nobody revisits is indistinguishable from a suppressed finding

"""Watch the `ignoreUntil` dates in every osv-scanner.toml.

`osv-scanner` stops honouring an ignore once its `ignoreUntil` passes, so the
vulnerability reappears and the scan reddens on its own. What it never does is
warn you *beforehand*, or notice an acceptance that carries no end date at all.
Both leave a `reason` string standing long after the constraint it describes has
gone — the failure mode recorded in realmindsai/speaker-id#53, where 18 of 21
entries had quietly stopped matching anything.

Ported from speaker-id (PR #60) into the fleet-stamped CI payload so it ships in
the same re-stamp pass rather than becoming a second fleet-wide edit
(realmindsai/security#6). One level differs from that original: an entry with no
`ignoreUntil` is an **error** here, not a warning. All 69 ignore entries across
the 11 repos in the estate that have an osv-scanner.toml already carry a date, so
the stricter level reddens nothing on arrival — and an acceptance with no end
date is exactly the one that never comes up for review. An advisory that really
is unfixable can carry a far-future date and still surface; that costs one line.

Stdlib only, on purpose: this runs from the stamped payload with a bare
`python3`, with no uv sync, no venv and no network.

Exit status: 1 if any entry has lapsed, is undated, or cannot be read, else 0.
Entries expiring soon are reported as warnings and do not fail.
